            Our school canteen is the “one-stop solution to all our problems”. Not a day goes by when the counters of the canteen are not crowded, or when students are not found merrily chatting away in its vicinity. There is a certain inviting, insouciant charm (apart from the wafting fragrance of delicious samosas) that pulls students to it; a cheerful aura around the canteen staff that makes everyone feel comfortable. A birthday is unimaginable and incomplete without a visit to the canteen, which offers a range of delectable treats for watering mouths - from samosas to chat, cold drinks, ice cream, chips,Chocolates- you name it! By the efforts of our late principal, Sr. Mary Jayashree, our new school canteen stands as a splendid structure next to the small field, its four marble counters waiting to be surrounded by flocks of students; to witness their jolly conversations and to serve them again, as it does every day,life indeed with a pinch of salt.
